## Submissions
Before adding test cases, follow this procedure so that the master branch doesn't get corrupted:
1. Pull the most updated verison of master before adding your test cases (`git pull origin master`)
2. Checkout a branch for the case(s) you want to add (`git checkout -b [test-case]`)
3. Add your test cases(s) to the README.
4. Add and commit your changes.
5. Push that branch, not to master (`git push [test-case]`)
6. Open a pull request on Github.
7. Slack the sf-0517 with the link to the pull request and have someone merge to master for you.
